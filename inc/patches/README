1) Added support for shared session cache using shared memory between multiple
   processes - this is available only on Linux and requires the multithreading
   synchronization mechanism already present in matrixSSL
2) Added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV
3) Added partial support for "status_request" TLS extension - this is only
   partially implemented because it doesn't handle responder IDs or OCSP
   extensions received with the "status_request" TLS extension
4) Added support for Certificate Transparency through the
   "signed_certificate_timestamp" TLS extension
5) Implemented server preferred ciphers - selecting matrixSSL strongest
   ciphers from the client supported list
6) Bug fixes
