1) Added support for shared session cache using shared memory between multiple
   processes - this is available only on Linux and requires the multithreading
   synchronization mechanism already present in matrixSSL
2) Added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV
3) Added partial support for "status_request" TLS extension - this is only
   partially implemented because it doesn't handle responder IDs or OCSP
   extensions received with the "status_request" TLS extension
4) Added support for Certificate Transparency through the
   "signed_certificate_timestamp" TLS extension
5) Implemented server preferred ciphers - selecting matrixSSL strongest
   ciphers from the client supported list
6) Changed the way CLIENT_HELLO message is processed to enforce HTTP/2
   security restrictions.

   Was:
     - select cipher
     - process extensions

   Current:
     - process SNI extension (if provided)
     - process ALPN extension (if provided)
       - if application protocol is HTTP/2 (h2)
         - make sure TLS 1.2 is used - return SSL_ALERT_INSUFFICIENT_SECURITY otherwise
         - replace the list of supported ciphers with the one approved by HTTP/2 specs
           https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#BadCipherSuites
     - select cipher (from the HTTP/2 approved list)
     - process other extensions

7) Bug fixes
